# Ambassadeur

Mobile game app built with React Native.

Two teams compete in a mime race.
In each team, an ambassador have to make his teammates guess a word or an expression.
As soon as a team has found it, they send a new ambassador get the next word.
And so on until a team has reached the end of the list !

The game can be played with or without a gamemaster. 
Words and expressions can be provided by the game (no gamemaster required) or someone can feed in the list and became gamemaster.
